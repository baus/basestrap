This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Notes:
* Discussion on exposing poolData on the client: https://github.com/aws/amazon-cognito-identity-js/issues/312
* The sample code is out of date with the latest API.
* reactstrap should have NavbarText element
* Saw this issue in react-cognito: https://github.com/isotoma/react-cognito/issues/21

TODO:

* Implement change password workflow
* Implement change Change email? Is this possible?
