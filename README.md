This is a boilerplate project for new web applications using AWS Cognito, React, and Bootstrap. You can fork the
repository to start a new project.

Notes:

* Discussion on exposing poolData on the client: https://github.com/aws/amazon-cognito-identity-js/issues/312
* The sample code is out of date with the latest Cognito JS API
* reactstrap should have NavbarText element
* Saw this issue in react-cognito: https://github.com/isotoma/react-cognito/issues/21

TODO:

* Remove dependency on Redux and react-cognito
* Implement change password workflow
* Implement change email? Is this possible?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
