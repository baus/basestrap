# CognitoStrap

CognitoStrap is a boilerplate project for new web applications using [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), 
[React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). You can fork the repository to start a 
new project.

Example is here: [CognitoStrap](http://cognitostrap.org) 

Notes:

* Discussion on exposing poolData on the client: https://github.com/aws/amazon-cognito-identity-js/issues/312
* The sample code is out of date with the latest Cognito JS API
* reactstrap should have NavbarText element
* Saw this issue in react-cognito: https://github.com/isotoma/react-cognito/issues/21

TODO:

* Implement change email. Is this possible?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
